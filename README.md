I'm a fourth year @ UGA studying Computer Science + International Affairs. Currently, I'm:
-  📡  Helping beam memes into Low-Earth-Orbit with **[MEMESat-1](https://letsgo2space.com/memesat-1-3/)**
-  🔧  Developing **[JADE](https://github.com/sudhanchitgopkar/jade)**, a lightweight graphics package made from scratch
-  🧮  Creating mathematical visualizations and **[generative art](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=la8MevQxLZw)**
-  💻  Working as an SDE intern @ **Amazon**
-  🐶  Advising (ex-director) **[UGAHacks](https://ugahacks.com/)**

If I'm not doing any of those things, you can probably find me [listening](https://open.spotify.com/user/sudhan.chitgopkar?si=7047f7e2c1224def) to music, tinkering with code, or exploring.
